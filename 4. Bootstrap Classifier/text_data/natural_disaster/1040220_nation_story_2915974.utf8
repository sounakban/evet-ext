The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Industry breathes life into quake-hit 
Bhuj, Feb. 19 (Reuters): A security guard in a bright blue uniform frisks Baburam Humble at the iron gate before he is let into the newly-built factory office where he works.																								Humble then punches in to begin a long day of taking orders from superiors and attending to the factorys steady stream of visitors. But he is not complaining.																								I was completely at a loss after the earthquake, not knowing how to face the tragedy, the 29-year-old said.																								This new factory has given me not only a livelihood, but also the strength to forget what happened in 2001.																								Measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, the earthquake had killed nearly 20,000 people and flattened residential complexes and businesses across large parts here.																								Humble, who lost all his savings after the concrete-roofed house he shared with his four brothers collapsed in the quake, has begun a new chapter in his life with Rs 2,500 a month he earns from the detergent and chemical factory.																								Three years on, 150 industrial units are already functional or under construction in the Kutch region, and the development is transforming the region into a major industrial hub.																								Like Humble, thousands of Kutchis from this arid region on the Pakistan border are now rebuilding their lives with help from the industrial community, which, in turn, gets tax breaks for setting up there.																								The huge piles of debris and mangled metal from the flattened buildings in Bhuj, Anjar and Bachhau, three major towns destroyed by the quake, are giving way to multi-storied buildings and factories protected by iron gates and barbed wire fences.																								The tax breaks are helping Kutch gain an altogether new look, said F.S. Negi, general manager at PSL Holdings Ltd, which makes 60,000 tonnes of steel pipes per year. It is also helping quake survivors find much-needed livelihoods.																								In an attempt to spur investment and generate employment for those hit hardest by the quake, the central and state governments offer a maximum 24 per cent tax rebate for up to 10 years for industrial units set up between July 31, 2001, and July 31, 2004.																								While 81 small and medium-sized projects with an estimated investment of Rs 5 billion are already working, 58 projects worth a total investment of Rs 25 billion are at various stages of implementation.																								And a total of nearly Rs 31 billion has been pledged for fresh investments in sectors as diverse as edible oil refining, detergent and soap manufacturing, metal pipes and ceramic tiles.																								Officials of Gujarat Industrial Extension Bureau, which is leading the initiative to attract investors, say the new units will directly generate at least 80,000 jobs as well as several hundred thousands indirect jobs.																								These new investments are not only generating employment, it has added to the confidence of the local masses, H.C. Desai, the bureaus chief general manager, said.																								Derawar Singh, an 18-year-old migrant from neighbouring Rajasthan, is one beneficiary of Kutchs new industrial activity.																								I earn enough to run my family of five back home because of this new factory. Maybe I can earn more with units coming up, said Singh, who runs a restaurant in an industrial area near Anjar.																								The presence of two major ports on the west coast, the state-run Kandla and privately operated Mundra, and better road and rail networks are also helping Kutchs mushrooming industry.																								The ports are a major attraction. Kutch also has a locational advantage as it can cater to the vast north and western hinterland of India, said Negi.																								Officials say Kutchs new-found status as an investment magnet has sharply pushed up land prices.
