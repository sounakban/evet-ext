				 																																										lThe excise department on Friday issued a circular allowing all liquor off and on shops in the city to stay open during the Puja days, except on Ashtami. Earlier, the city police had initiated a move to keep all the off-shops and bars closed on all four Puja days in a bid to curb crime during the festival. But the excise department officials struck down the proposal, saying it would hamper tourism in the city. According to the circular, the off-shops in the city will remain open from 9 am to 10 pm and the bars from 11 am to 12 midnight. A bar can extend the time upto 2 am on prior approval of the authorities and paying late-closing fees to the excise department. No off-shop and bar will stay open on Ashtami. Shops and bars on Dashami will stay open from 9 am to 3 pm and the bars from 11 am to 12 midnight. The timing applies to off-shops and bars in Salt Lake as well. In the suburbs, off-shop and bar owners can extend the closing time by an hour.
