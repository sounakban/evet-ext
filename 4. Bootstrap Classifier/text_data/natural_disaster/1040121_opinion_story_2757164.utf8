		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 							 																						WHEN NATURAL CALAMITY STRIKES Shobita Punja																					January 26, 2001 at 8.46 am, when the nation was preparing to celebrate our 52nd Republic Day, an earthquake struck the state of Gujarat. It was of enormous magnitude, between 7-8 points on the Richter scale with its epicentre just 20 kilometres northeast of Bhuj. The death and destruction that followed the earthquake spread over 15,000 kilometres with the loss of life estimated at 20,000, apart from loss of livestock and crores worth of property.																					The earthquake took everyone by surprise, but that is the character of natural calamities. No one was prepared for this scale of devastation and the lack of facilities was evident on many fronts  most important was the instant distribution of medical care on a large scale.																					In terms of the irreplaceable loss of national, cultural and historic assets of Gujarat, the earthquake exposed another aspect of our lack of preparedness and concern. The Archaeological Survey of India and the state department of archaeology in subsequent weeks estimated that over 900 protected monuments had been affected by the earthquake and needed urgent attention. The region of Kutch, known to be in the seismic zone with a record of tremors every 30-50 years, has one of Indias most beautiful traditions of vernacular building and extraordinary crafts traditions of communities who have adapted to the harsh near-desert environment over centuries.																					The 100-year-old Kutch Museum had caved in and buried rare antiques and art treasures in the rubble. The Aaina Mahal, palace of the rulers of Bhuj, that had partially been converted into a museum, lay in ruins, shrouding its precious objects in dust.																					Leveller																					The earthquake, like all natural phenomena, made no distinction between caste or religion or class and colour and devastated the Jubilee Hospital, the Fateh Mohammeds tomb, the Kalyaneshwar Temple, the Jail and the Alfred School in Bhuj.																					The beautiful Chattris outside Bhuj, erected to commemorate the royal family, was a favourite set for Bollywood films such as Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The majestic Chattris have now been reduced to rubble and ruins.																					The Rajkot area lost Jain and Hindu temples, dargahs and mosques of the medieval period. Even in Ahmedabad the quake damaged Gandhis historic meeting place, the Hriday Kunj, where he had sat spinning his charka in the Sabarmati Ashram.																					The clock tower at the Ranjit Vilas palace in Wankaner was seriously damaged and the clock had stopped at 8.46 am.																					May Republic Day each year be a reminder for all of us that we are not prepared. Each one of us must ask should an earthquake, flood, natural disaster happen unexpectedly today somewhere in India  do we have a task force to bring aid immediately to the injured and the dying, food and shelter for the homeless and helpless?																					Always on alert																					We need to have a well-formulated and rehearsed strategy for the protection and conservation of homes and private property. The Archaeological Survey of India and the state department of archaeology should have a manual for the protection of historic and cultural property during natural calamities. These departments must train their staff on how to respond efficiently and effectively during times of disaster.																					A photographic record and listing of historic and culturally important buildings of each city of India should be undertaken now. We need adequate documentation ready to help us repair and restore these buildings of historic value to their former glory.																					For people who have been traumatized, the psychological effect of restoring landmarks of a city, is immediately reassuring. When they see familiar landmarks again, when temples and mosques are back in use, the old post office and schools are working again  healing begins. When the majestic clock tower is chiming again telling us to get on with life once more, it should also remind us that anything can happen anytime  be prepared.
