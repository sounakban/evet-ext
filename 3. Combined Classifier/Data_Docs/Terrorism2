New Delhi, Sept. 26: Al Badr or Jaish-e-Mohammad might be behind the terror attack on the Swaminarayan temple in Gandhinagar, sleuths believe. Intelligence agencies are certain that the attackers were not local Gujaratis, though the identities of the two slain militants are yet to be established.																								Al Badr is a tiny Pakistan-based group operating mainly in Kashmir and is often used by the Pakistan intelligence for specific tasks in the state. Unlike during the attacks on Parliament and the Kaluchak army camp, the temple attackers have not left any tell-tale signs behind.																								Indian agencies say the ISI is making certain that fingers dont point to Pakistan. The dry fruits carried by the two attackers had Indian labels.																								The Tehreek-e-Kasas leaflets on the duo could be a red herring to confuse the authorities. Intelligence agencies say it could take some time to pinpoint which terror group was behind the attack, but they are confident of tracking it down.																								Officials have not ruled out the involvement of Jaish-e-Mohammad either. But intelligence sources here have so far no evidence of Lashkar-e-Toibas hand. Each terror group leaves its own signature behind, the signals so far dont point to Lashkar, one senior official said.																								The assumption that the gunmen were connected to groups in Kashmir linked to Pakistan was backed by Jammu police. Dilbagh Singh, DIG, Jammu Range, said some people from Gujarat, apprehended three months ago, had been keen to cross over to Pakistan for training.
