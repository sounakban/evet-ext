The Prime Minister today promised Narendra Modi that he would forward his request for a tax holiday for Kutch to finance minister Jaswant Singh <time>.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee made this promise while dedicating the multi-speciality GK General Hospital, reconstructed from the Prime Ministers Relief Fund, to the people of Kutch <donation_needs_or_offers_or_volunteering_services>.

The Gujarat chief minister, known for fiery speeches and abrasive behaviour, broke down while recalling the January 26, 2001, earthquake that devastated Kutch and also affected the rest of the state <Earthquake ; time>.
I salute the zeal of (the) Kutchhi people, Modi said in a choked voice. 
The chief minister went on to recall the help he had received from the Prime Minister in tackling the disaster <donation_needs_or_offers_or_volunteering_services>.

He said Gujarat had recovered from the earthquake in less than three years <Earthquake ; time>.

Japan, Mexico and Turkey have taken longer to rebuild after suffering earthquakes in recent years, Modi added <time>.
But this was possible with the cooperation and supervision of the Prime Minister, he said, describing Vajpayee as a father figure who had taught him how to walk. 
Vajpayee recalled the heart-rending scenes he witnessed at GK Hospital that collapsed during the quake, killing 182 people <Earthquake ; infrastructure_and_utilities_damage ; injured_or_dead_people>.

He described the reconstruction as victory of life over death and said he saw tremendous scope for the hospital to expand <injured_or_dead_people>.
Dedicating the 300-bed hospital to the nation, the Prime Minister promised to open a medical college in Bhuj. 
He offered central assistance for a corpus for this state-of-the-art hospital, which is to be run with the help of public sector units <donation_needs_or_offers_or_volunteering_services>.
Vajpayee said the hospital could become a major centre for medicare and medical tourism. A nursing college has already started, he said, adding that there should now be a medical college in Bhuj. On the demand for a tax holiday, he said: I will work as your postman to convey your demand to the finance minister. The Prime Minister said Gujarat had done well in medicare but should strive to improve the human development index as it still lags behind in literacy and health care. 
GK Hospital has been rebuilt with earthquake-resistant technology developed on the New Zealand model of base-isolation technology that can withstand quakes as high as 8 on the Richter scale <Earthquake>.

The technology uses lead-rubber bearings to isolate and protect structures during earthquakes <Earthquake>.

Earlier, Modi announced that Gujarat would soon have a world-class seismic institute <Earthquake>.

He revealed that Vajpayee was so concerned about post-quake relief that he had appointed an officer to look after rehabilitation and monitored the progress <Earthquake ; donation_needs_or_offers_or_volunteering_services>.
