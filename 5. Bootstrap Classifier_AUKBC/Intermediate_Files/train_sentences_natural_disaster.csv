"First, the most common and best-researched method of transmission is via the use of contaminated injection equipment among people who inject drugs","('Epidemic',)"
"Second, there is sexual transmission of the virus between those who inject drugs and their sexual partners","('Epidemic',)"
The dual transmission risk in the case of sex workers who also inject drugs leads to epidemics that expand quickly and act as a bridge to the rest of the population,"('Epidemic',)"

"While the relationship between injecting drug use and HIV/AIDS is relatively well researched, little systematic epidemiological information is available on the extent and patterns of HIV transmission caused by non-injecting drug use","('Epidemic',)"
"This is unfortunate because there is emerging evidence that the use of cocaine, crack and ATS increases sexual risk taking behaviour related to HIV transmission...However, to date, an epidemiological review of HIV/AIDS related to drug use still has to rely mostly on information related to injecting drug use, which undoubtedly underestimates the real impact of drug use on the HIV/AIDS epidemics","('Epidemic',)"
"Consequently, prevention of HIV transmission related to drug use continues to focus mostly on injecting drug use, missing out the potential opportunities of primary and secondary drug use prevention for stopping the spread of the virus","('Epidemic',)"
"In the early stages of the pandemic, HIV/AIDS among injecting drug users was largely viewed as self-limiting, affecting injectors and their immediate sexual partners but not leading to a more generalized spread of the virus","('Epidemic',)"
"Globally, it is estimated that 5-10 per cent of all HIV infections are attributable to injecting drug use, mostly via the use of contaminated injection equipment","('Epidemic',)"
