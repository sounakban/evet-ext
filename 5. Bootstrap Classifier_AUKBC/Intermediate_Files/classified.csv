"As a nation, it would be most shameful of us if we were to let such an act of glorification of deaths and destruction take place, Paswan and Mishra told the President, slamming the intention behind the Gaurav Yatra.","['', 'injured_or_dead_people']"

The state government had claimed that 58 people had died in coach S-6.,['injured_or_dead_people']
"Hinting that the entire incident was pre-planned, Paswan wondered how subsequent forensic reports had indicated that the inflammable material could have been poured from inside the bogie.",['']
"The leaders said it was shocking to learn that while the Prime Minister himself had termed the violence as a national shame, his party was trying to glorify the riots.","['', 'Rebellion']"
